# python_pomodoro

A Pomodoro Timer Application using Python and Tkinter.

This project aims to develop my skills in: OOP, event-driven programming, UI/UX design, testing and validation, software deployment.

**What is the Pomodoro technique?**

Method of time management to help improve productivity:

- Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break.
- After 4 cycles, take a longer break (e.g., 15-30 minutes).
